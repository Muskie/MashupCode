This is the README file for my web mashup PHP code. It relies on many APIs and other open source projects.
I've also had to modify two neglected open source code libraries which I've included in this repository. In addition to all 
this code you will need:

	The official Facebook PHP code : http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/
	Vadim's Facebook code : http://vadimg.com/2010/05/05/facebook-php-library-graph-social-plugins-search-posting-and-more/
	Tweetify.inc : https://github.com/fiveminuteargument/tweetify
	phpFlickr : http://phpflickr.com/
	phpBrainz : https://github.com/olds/phpbrainz
	
I recommend following the instructions on this webpage:

	http://www.muschamp.ca/Muskie/webMashups.html
	
I can be reached at andrew [at] muschamp.ca if the code documentation is insufficient.

Ignore this line it is to test GitHub's Mac Client.
