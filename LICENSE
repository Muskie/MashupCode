I'm no open source license expert. I used a lot of open source code to build my web mashups and they used various licenses.

I chose the MIT License as it seemed simpler. This should be included in every PHP file I created from scratch:

I'd prefer my code not be used in commercial projects without at least acknowledging my contribution, asking permission first would be cool.
